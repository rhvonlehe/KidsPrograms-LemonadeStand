# KidsPrograms-LemonadeStand
1 to 3 player lemonade stand

This was loosely based on the work here:
https://github.com/jeremydosborn/lemonade_stand

I wanted a simple program my kids, 6 and 10, could appreciate that 
might encourage the 10-year old to learn a bit more about Python.

I converted it to be a little more object-oriented, and added
the ability to allow up to 3 players.
